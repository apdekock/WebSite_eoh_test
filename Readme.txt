Comments:
- Irritating Alert on EmployeeAdd to demo Signal R
- Very Vanilla, Not very responsive / SPA type app - possibly use ReactJS (currently learning)
- Exception Handling not done, time constraints.
- No logging - however Nlog with file sink would be choice.
- DatabasePath is relative - so should work out of the box.
